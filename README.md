### Business problem:

Objective:

- For this project, you have been hired to produce a MySQL database on Movies from a subset of IMDB's publicly available dataset. Ultimately, you will use this database to analyze what makes a movie successful and will provide recommendations to the stakeholder on how to make a successful movie.

Scope:

- Over the course of this project, you will:
  - Part 1: Download several files from IMDB’s movie data set and filter out the subset of moves requested by the stakeholder.
  - Part 2: Use an API to extract box office revenue and profit data to add to your IMDB data and perform exploratory data analysis.
  - Part 3: Construct and export a MySQL database using your data.
  - Part 4: Apply hypothesis testing to explore what makes a movie successful.
  - Part 5 (Optional): Produce a Linear Regression model to predict movie performance.

Dataset:

IMDB Provides Several Files with varied information for Movies, TV Shows, Made for TV Movies, etc.
